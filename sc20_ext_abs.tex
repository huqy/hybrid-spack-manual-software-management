\section{Introduction}\label{sec_intro}

%%{\color{gray}(1) General challenge}
Keeping scientific computing software packages up-to-date and easy to use for users in a research university environment is always a challenge when the number of scientific packages on the HPC cluster is large.
%%%Keeping scientific computing software packages up-to-date and easy to use for users is of ultimate importance to a successful campus high performance computing (HPC) cluster operation in a research university environment.
%%%In practice, this can pose a challenge on a small operational team when the number of scientific packages on the HPC cluster is large (e.g. in the hundreds that we considered in this work). 
%%%Keeping every software installation up to date and providing persistent support to the diverse user needs are tedious and time-consuming if done manually.
%%%The combinatorial naming and versioning complexities result in large number of package sets (e.g. built by different tool sets and optimized libraries), module files and the corresponding documents that need to be maintained by the operational team. 
%%{\color{gray}(2) framework solution's advantages}
A common solution for this challenge is to use an software management framework, such as EasyBuild\cite{geimer:14} and Spack\cite{gamblin:15}, to simplify or automate the mundane process. 
%%%In a software management framework, the configre-build-deploy process is done in a systematic fashion; such an approach promises to largely improve HPC cluster's operational efficiency. 
%%{\color{gray}(3) framework solution's limitations}
However, as the software management frameworks, are still under development, albeit very powerful, a few limitations are noted in practice if a framework is used as a solely suite to manage software packages.
%%%First, from the cluster operation's standpoint, the restrictions from the frameworks may not be compatible with the site's existing/legacy package installation structure (referred to as manually-installed packages, including those done by in-house installation scripts), even for the most flexible framework solution that we consider in this work (i.e. Spack). ({\color{red} Shall we called it "locally-installed" vs. "framework-installed" instead? "manual" seems misleading.}) 
Especially it is not possible to conveniently plug framework-installed packages into the existing manually-installed structures without significantly altering how the framework works. 
%%%Second, it is difficult produce a consistent view of available software modules to users when the framework's module file naming conventions are different from that defined by the operation team. 
%%%Third, It is always difficult to manage software and dependencies built outside of the tools. 
%%%Fourth, the framework's systematic handling on library dependencies results in many duplicate builds of the same software; this can create confusion if presented to users at once.
%%%Fifth, we note that a number of new, but less mature, functionalities in the framework are unable to handle corner cases that we encountered in practice. Given the above considerations, it would be ideal to have a way to take advantage of the powerful capability of framework approach and at the same time maintain compatibility complying to the operational team's design goals in terms of scientific package management.

%%{\color{gray}(4) our approach and values/contributions of our work}
In this paper we propose a practical approach for HPC cluster operational team to manage software packages by hybridizing the framework-based and the manual installation approaches. 
From a software design point of view, the central idea is to add a layer above the software management frameworks, where a mechanism is introduced to manage applications built either from the framework or from manual installation to enable flexible customization, complying to the existing software infrastructures of the HPC cluster environment.
In this work, we use Spack as the candidate package management framework tool but the proposed approach is quite general, not limited to a particular software management framework. We consider the deployment of the hybrid approach on UCLA Hoffman2 Cluster where the practice of manual package building environment already exists.
It should be noted that we keep framework-installed and manually-installed packages decoupled as much as possible, so that it allows future adjustments when the frameworks or the HPC site's organization is further developed. 
Our main contribution is a noble way to manipulate and re-organize the module files and propose a practical, automated and scriptable workflow to manage the building and maintaining processes and provide a coherent view to end users.


%%%\section{Managing Module Files} \label{sec_modulefiles}

%%%\subsection{Module file management in Spack}
\section{Defining modulefile structures in user level} \label{subsec_redefine_h2_modulefiles}

%%{\color{gray}General}
%%%Adding a flexible management layer on top of framework rely on the exploration of the detailed module file structure generated by the framework.
%%%In Spack, module files are automatically generated during the installation and it systematically collects all dependent libraries and provide the corresponding modules. 
%%%The structure and format for module files are controlled by Spack's yaml scripts (\verb|config.yaml| and \verb|modules.yaml|).
%%% and it can generate both flat and hierarchical structured module files at the same time. 

%%{\color{gray}Flat}
%%%The flat TCL/C module file structure generated by Spack has a straight-forward naming scheme under the root place with simple listing of package names 
%%%concatenating the version and compiler/mpi information with unique hash code. 
%%%As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:spack_flat} of an example that we installed on Hoffman2, different installations of each package are stored in the corresponding directory as TCL/C module files with a name concatenating the application version, compiler name, compiler version, and the mpi name and version. Plus, the TCL/C module files appends the unique hash code in order to distinguish the duplication names from minor difference of installations with the same version and same compiler/mpi info.
%%%
%%%\begin{figure}[htbp]
%%%  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/spack_flat}}
%%%  \caption{Flat structure of module files generated by Spack}
%%%  \label{fig:spack_flat}
%%%\end{figure}

%%{\color{gray}Hierarchical}
%%%At the same time, the hierarchical module files generated by Spack follows the typical Core/Compiler/MPI structures
%%%Fig.~\ref{fig:spack_hier} shows an example of our modules.yaml configuration on Hoffman2. 
%%%It can be noticed that the software installations are organized 
%%%in a convoluted way.
%%%, which means the applications under ``Core'' are the simplest with only dependency on system libraries, the ones under ``Compiler''s are dependent on the Spack-installed compilers only, the ones under ``MPI'' are dependent on both compilers and mpis. In Fig.~\ref{fig:spack_hier} we introduced customized ``openblas'' category to test the customization capabilities of Spack's modules.yaml. It can be understood as the in-between level of Compiler and MPI, which obviously adds more complexity in the MPI level directory. Every package installed is listed as a folder as its name under the corresponding directory levels. The module files for different versions are \texttt{lua} files with \texttt{.lua} extension and have a simpler name with its own version plus the unique hash code if necessary.

%%%\begin{figure}[htbp]
%%%  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/spack_hier}}
%%%  \caption{Hierarchical structure of module files generated by Spack}
%%%  \label{fig:spack_hier}
%%%\end{figure}


Adding a flexible management layer on top of framework rely on the exploration of the detailed module file structure generated by the framework.
From our working practice, the customization configuration through yaml files in Spack is limited and not flexible enough to meet the needs.
%%%Due to the systematic installation, the minor tweaks of flags and options for the same packages will be considered as different versions. 
%%%But the naming scheme from Spack yaml script is impossible to cover all the cases. 
Spack installation process always produces many duplication of installed packages/libs. Assigning a unique hash code for every version of all packages introduces the new confusions for general-level presentation to users.
At the same time, Hierarchical structure generated from Spack is fixed. In some situations of the convoluted file structure defined from Spack may not be preferable it has nno way to customize it. 
%%%In our Hoffman2 system, about 1/3 of existing packages in the HPC cluster has to be managed with the traditional manual way. 
%%%We need to design a neat hierarchical module file structure so that the module files from Spack can have a unique mapping and the manually generated module files can also comply the definition.

Based on our own experience and the understanding of ways to manage the module files on large scale HPC clusters (e.g. TACC), we propose the module files on Hoffman2 to be organized in a simple structure as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:h2_new_hier}, where the MPI level is nested in the compiler level. 
The versions of compilers and MPIs are following the convention in Spack. 
%%%We will use \texttt{lua} format which means the module files will have \texttt{.lua} extension. 
%%%\texttt{modulefiles} sub-directory is preserved for denoting to store the installed packages' module files from the upper directories from the corresponding compilers, or MPIs or both. 
The additional categories will be optional to be nested in Compiler level or Compiler+MPI levels if necessary. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/h2_new_hier}}
  \caption{Newly defined hierarchical structure of module files in Hoffman2}
  \label{fig:h2_new_hier}
\end{figure}

\section{Python scripts for modulefile processing}\label{subsec_modulefile_processing}

After the definition of the new module file structure, the hybridizing work of Spack (framework-based) and the manually-installed systems will be done by implementing a script to import the module file information automatically generated from Spack, filter out the confusing duplication packages and the not-to-be-supported packages, make desired modifications on the to-be-supported module files to enforce the safety features, and export to the destination folder which will be the default module path for general users.

Here we propose to a JSON-format list to contain the information about the packages that the system admins plan to support. An example of a JSON file will be like below.
%%%, where only 3 packages will be supported and the versions are listed by concatenating the compiler's information:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
{   "bowtie2": {
        "name_in_spack": "bowtie2",
        "version": [
            "2.3.4.1-gcc-7.2.0",
            "2.3.4.1-gcc-5.5.0"
        ],
        "default": "2.3.4.1"
    },
}
\end{verbatim}
}

%%%where the main name in the json object pair is the application name preferred by system admins. The \verb|name_in_spack| is the name used in Spack. It can be blank if there is no cooresponding one in Spack. The \verb|version| keeps the application version information and the corresponding compilers. The default version that will be shown or selected by the \verb|Lmod| system.

Our approach is to take advantage of Spack's capability of generating both flat and hierarchical module files by enabling them in modules.yaml configuration file. As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:modulefilter_flowchart}, we first iterate over Spack's hierarchical module structures to obtain the hierarchical information about the installed packages and the hash codes generated from Spack. All collected information will be saved in a Sqlite database file. Then we iterate over Spack's flat-structured module files to find the ones in the database with the same hash code. By cross-checking the customized JSON file to decide the display option for the packages we can make the corresponding modifications for the module files and copy it to the destination directory. The modifications specifically include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Using \texttt{tcl2lua.tcl} script to convert the \texttt{TCL/C} module file to \texttt{lua} format.
    \item Pre-pending \texttt{MODULEPATH} to enable the dynamically showing of available module files under the corresponding Compiler/MPI directories if necessary.
    \item Adding \texttt{family} to guarantee users can only load one compiler or MPI stack at a time, if necessary.
    \item Specifying the default version for the packages by generating \texttt{.version} file in the destination package modulefile folder.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/modulefilter_flowchart}}
  \caption{Flowchart for the python script to generate the newly defined module file structures for user-level presentations}
  \label{fig:modulefilter_flowchart}
\end{figure}

In the SQLite database file (\verb|apps.db|), there is currently only one table (\verb|apps|) in the database. The schema of the table can be reviewed by \verb|.schema apps| inside the SQLite shell. The detailed scripts have been published in the gitlab repo\cite{gitlabrepo}.


\section{Practical Workflows} \label{sec_workflow}

The practical process to hybridize the Spack-installed and manually-installed packages can be built based on the structures that were proposed in the above section. Specifically we can use the JSON file and SQLite file defined in Section \ref{subsec_modulefile_processing} to coordinate both ways of installation. Figure \ref{fig:spack_h2_hybrid_flow} below shows one possibility of workflow of installing a package, from the installation request to displaying the module.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/spack_h2_hybrid_flow}}
  \caption{Workflow to hybridize the Spack-installed and manually-installed packages}
  \label{fig:spack_h2_hybrid_flow}
\end{figure}

The workflow shows a basic process to check and install a newly requested application into the hybrid system. 
%%%A couple of notes are listed below for further explantation:
%%%
%%%\begin{itemize}
%%%    \item All the installation processes are assumed to be taken as a specific non-root user.
%%%    \item The standard SQL \verb|select| query would be used to check if the newly requested package with the specific requested version has been installed on Hoffman2 or not.
%%%    \item If installation is needed, the command \verb|spack list $APPNAME|\cite{spack:20} can be used to check if there is any available package whose name contains \verb|$APPNAME| Spack can install. 
%%%    \item If Spack provides the available package to install, the command \verb|spack install $APPNAME|\cite{spack:20} can be used to install it. As a reference, we installed 180+ packages on Hoffman2 using \verb|spack install| commands. 
%%%    \item For packages needed the manual installation, a SQL \verb|insert| command will be needed to populate the information into the database. It should be noted that the field \verb|apphash| has to leave blank as the flag to denote the installation is not from Spack.
%%%    \item The \verb|lmod| modulefile from manually installed package will needed to be written manually as well. It can be the \verb|TCL/C|-based script or \verb|lua|-based one, since the modulefilter script will do the conversion. The directory for drafting the module file can be arbitrary but has to be consistent with the value of the \verb|flatpath| in the database record inserted above.
%%%    \item The JSON file has to be updated according the schema described in Section \ref{subsec_modulefile_processing}. 
%%%\end{itemize}


\section{Summary} \label{sec_summary}

In this paper we proposed an approach to hybridize the software management framework and the traditional manual package management. The design is to build an additional layer on top of the framework for taking advantage of the automatic building and management from the framework and the highly customization requirement from the traditional manual management. With the definition of a neat common module file structure in the cluster environment, the python script is able to process, filter and re-direct the module files from the framework to any destination for final general-user presentation. A management workflow is also proposed as a practical reference.

\section{Ease of Use}

\subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

The IEEEtran class file is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, 
column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not 
alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin
measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement 
and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper 
as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. 
Please do not revise any of the current designations.

\section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on 
proofreading, spelling and grammar.

Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
for you.

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations}
Number equations consecutively. To make your 
equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
sentence, as in:
\begin{equation}
a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
\end{equation}

Be sure that the 
symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
citations without having to go through the file line by line.

Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
counting.

{\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

{\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
referenced as Table IV-B3. 

{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
surrounding equation.

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
\end{itemize}
An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
\textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

\subsection{Identify the Headings}
Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
should be introduced.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}
\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Table Type Styles}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Table}&\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Table Column Head}} \\
\cline{2-4} 
\textbf{Head} & \textbf{\textit{Table column subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}} \\
\hline
copy& More table copy$^{\mathrm{a}}$& &  \\
\hline
\multicolumn{4}{l}{$^{\mathrm{a}}$Sample of a Table footnote.}
\end{tabular}
\label{tab1}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics{fig1.png}}
\caption{Example of a figure caption.}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
``Temperature/K''.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
